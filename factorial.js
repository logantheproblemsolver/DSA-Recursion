// Write a recursive function that finds the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number can be found by multiplying that number by each number between itself and 1. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.


function factorial(number) {
    if (number === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (number === 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return number * factorial(number - 1)
}

factorial(5)
